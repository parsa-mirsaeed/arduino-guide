# Arduino Guide (راهنمای جامع آردوینو)

## Project Background

This project began as an academic presentation for a Microprocessor Laboratory course. The original material was prepared as a comprehensive presentation on Arduino microcontrollers, covering various aspects from the basics to advanced applications.

## Transformation to a Guide

I later decided to transform this academic presentation into a generalized guide that could benefit a wider audience interested in learning about Arduino.

## Content Overview

The guide covers:

- Introduction to Arduino and its significance
- History and development of Arduino
- Core components and hardware details
- Different Arduino board types and their applications
- Practical applications in various fields:
  - Educational projects
  - Robotics
  - Smart home systems
  - Agriculture and environmental monitoring
  - Internet of Things (IoT)

## Language

The guide is written in Farsi (Persian) to serve the Persian-speaking community interested in electronics and microcontrollers.

## Access
